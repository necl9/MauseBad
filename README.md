# MauseBad
A small Windows script to replace your mouse with keystrokes - Vim style.

# Dependancies:
AutoHotkey v2.0 or later.
https://www.autohotkey.com/

...Because, you know - it's an AutoHotkey script.

# Installation:
After installing AutoHotkey, just double-click on MouseBad.ahk - and it should show as a running program in the tray.
And because it's just a script, you can always open it with your text-editor and modify however you like.

# Keybindings and Configuration:
Your active config is in "config/config.ahk"
All other files in the "config/" directory are different configs that you can use by renaming them into "config.ahk".
Copy and modify it to your heart's content.

By default CapsLock is to enter/exit "Mouse Layer" (you should see a pic-notification in the top-left corner of your screen).

For now, I made 2 different configs for "Mouse Layer": 
- Intuitive:
    - l: move and click Left Mouse Button.
    - r: move and click Right Mouse Button.
    - m: move and click Middle Mouse Button.
    - j: "Jump". Moves the mouse to the target location.
    - c: just a click. Left Mouse Button.
    - k: click and drag. ...Because d was already taken.
    - u: mouse wheel Up.
    - d: mouse wheel Down.
    - s+u: "Super" wheel up. Precisely 8 times faster.
    - s+d: "Super" wheel down.
    - i: left arrow. ...Beause hjkl already taken. Use "Ergonomic" config for hjkl.
    - o: down arrow.
    - p: up arrow.
    - [: right arrow.
    - Tab: Switch between screens. Or you can use numbers from 1 to 0 to choose the monitor you need directly.
    - Esc: to regain the control of your keyboard. :) The same as CapsLock - does not close the program.

- Ergonomic:
    - w: move and click Left Mouse Button.
    - r: move and click Right Mouse Button.
    - e: move and click Middle Mouse Button.
    - f: "Jump". Moves the mouse to the target location.
    - c: just a click. Left Mouse Button.
    - q: click and drag. ...Because d was already taken.
    - u: mouse wheel Up.
    - d: mouse wheel Down.
    - s+u: "Super" wheel up. Precisely 8 times faster.
    - s+d: "Super" wheel down.
    - h: left arrow. ...Beause hjkl already taken. Use "Ergonomic" config for hjkl.
    - j: down arrow.
    - k: up arrow.
    - l: right arrow.
    - Tab: Switch between screens. Or you can use numbers from 1 to 0 to choose the monitor you need directly.
    - Esc: to regain the control of your keyboard. :) The same as CapsLock - does not close the program.
